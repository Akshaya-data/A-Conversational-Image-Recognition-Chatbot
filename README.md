# A-Conversational-Image-Recognition-Chatbot

## Project Description

The **Conversational Image Recognition Chatbot**, named **VisuaLingua**, is an advanced AI application designed to facilitate natural language conversations about images. This project integrates cutting-edge computer vision and natural language processing technologies to enable users to upload images and receive intelligent, context-aware responses. By addressing the limitations of traditional chatbots that primarily focus on text or voice interactions, VisuaLingua enhances user experience through multimodal interaction.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can easily upload images for analysis.
- **Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv5/YOLOv8 models to accurately identify and label objects within images.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extracts text from images using Tesseract OCR, allowing the chatbot to read and interpret printed content.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Powered by OpenAI's GPT-4, the chatbot generates coherent and contextually relevant responses to user queries.
- **Multi-Turn Dialogue**: Supports engaging conversations, enabling users to ask follow-up questions and receive clarifications.
- **User -Friendly Interface**: Built with a responsive web interface for intuitive user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Computer Vision**: YOLOv5/YOLOv8 for object detection, OpenCV for image processing
- **OCR**: Tesseract OCR for text extraction
- **Natural Language Processing**: OpenAI GPT-4 for conversational AI
- **Database**: SQLite/PostgreSQL for session management and data storage
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization, cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud) for hosting

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Conversational-Image-Recognition-Chatbot.git
   
   cd Conversational-Image-Recognition-Chatbot
   

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:
   
   python -m venv venv
   
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

5. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key: OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   
6. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Flask server: python app.py
   
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the chatbot interface.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration of voice input and output for hands-free interaction.
- Support for multiple languages to cater to a global audience.
- Improved OCR capabilities for better text extraction from various image types.
- Development of mobile applications for Android and iOS platforms.
